# Drillstring Test Cases
## Introduction
This repository contains test cases for drill strings.

The aim of this repository is to provide general input suitable for use with any model, rather than input tailored to a specific model. Inputs are offered in digital format to eliminate the need to manually copy values from papers or other sources.

Sample outputs are provided as examples for comparison, not as exhaustive results for every model. These outputs, offered in digital format for convenience, are meant to guide users in evaluating their own model's results. Since outputs may not match exactly, users must exercise judgment in assessing the similarity of their results to the provided examples.

## Test Cases 1-4
These are a set of 6 test cases (1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4a, 4b).  They are documented in this [report](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/notes-and-documents/tree/main/2023%20Drillstring%20Modeling%20Report) and summarized in this [paper](https://onepetro.org/SPEATCE/proceedings-abstract/24ATCE/24ATCE/D011S008R004/563520).

These test cases were specifically designed to compare drillstring models.  They start from a simple case and gradually grow more complex to allow debugging of any differences observed.
